# Overview of Obsidian Fractals
## The problem
There are two essential problem that this system is attempting to solve.

### Knowledge doesn't scale
When trying to organize your entire life, one vault of notes quickly becomes chaotic. It either becomes a dumping ground, or the organization structure becomes too burdensome to maintain. In other words, it doesn't scale. While multiple vaults help, it loses the interconnectedness of a single vault.

### Knowledge isn't easy to share
In addition to scaling issues, we also want to share data. One common problem is sharing knowledge between our personal and work lives. Sharing too much or too little is bad, but finding that sweet spot in the middle makes us more organized and productive. And that may not be the only thing we want to share either. We might want to share notes with friends, coworkers, followers, or the whole world. Adding different sharing methods, and keeping each chunk organized adds a staggering level of complexity.

## Goals
Knowledge must be scalable and sharable. Let's define what that means

As a knowledge worker, I want to:
- find any chunk of knowledge when I need it
- share my knowledge with others
- integrate knowledge from others and have it automatically link into my knowledge structure

In addtion, it's important to:
- reorganize knowledge easily
- support many sharing methods
- adapt to different mixes of plugins and tools
- coexist with other knowledge management strutures

## Approach
Obsidian Fractals fragments knowledge into separate repositories that can be linked together in predictable and easy-to-navigate ways. It's a Lego set of knowledge blocks, a way to combine tiny blocks into larger blocks that seemlessly fit together.
