# Advanced usage
### Private notes for public topics
Creating your own private notes for topics in shared repositories is easy. So for this topic, create "a note named fractal knowledge private notes in fractal knowledge".

## Singular vs plural
Everything seems to read best when a note type is singular, and topics are plural, like "a topic in topics."

### Symlinks
Obsidian seems to work well with repositories as symlinks to other parts of your file system. So if sharing is already set up, you can symlink folders in as repositories.

## Sharing via git
Git repositories make near ideal sharing mechanisms. It is designed for collaboration for text based files, with version control, synchronization, and security baked in. When publishing with a git repo, it is suggested to copy the main topic to the README file, replacing wikilinks with relative url links. This will allow people to preview the repository their browser.

Most git providers provide a way to tag repositories to make them easier to find. For example, GitHub uses [topics](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/managing-your-repositorys-settings-and-features/customizing-your-repository/classifying-your-repository-with-topics). It is suggested that knowledge repositories be tagged as `fractal-knowledge`, to create an easy mechanism to find them.
